## **What is FFmpeg?**

FF ‚áí Fast Forward , mpeg ‚áí Moving Picture Experts Group

> The MPEG group is the alliance of working groups who are behind setting many of the most important video standards being used today including the MP4 format.
> 

<aside>
üí° MPEG stands for "Moving Picture Experts Group," and it refers to a set of standards developed by a working group of experts. The MPEG standards are focused on audio and video **compression** and **coding**. They define various methods for compressing audio and video data to enable efficient storage and transmission while maintaining acceptable quality.

</aside>

### MPEG standards

1. **MPEG-1**: This standard was introduced in the early 1990s and is responsible for formats like MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (MP3) for audio compression and Video CD (VCD) for video storage.
2. **MPEG-2**: Introduced in the late 1990s, MPEG-2 is used for digital television broadcasting, DVD videos, and some digital video broadcasting standards.
3. **MPEG-4**: This standard, introduced in the late 1990s as well, is more versatile and supports various multimedia applications, including video streaming, interactive multimedia, and mobile devices. It includes codecs like H.264 (also known as AVC) and AAC (Advanced Audio Codec).
4. **MPEG-7**: This standard focuses on the description of audiovisual content, enabling better searching, indexing, and retrieval of multimedia content.
5. **MPEG-21**: This standard aims to provide a framework for multimedia applications and services, enabling the integration of various multimedia technologies.
6. **MPEG-DASH**: Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is an adaptive streaming protocol based on MPEG standards, allowing for efficient video streaming over the internet.
7. **MPEG-H**: MPEG-H Audio is an audio codec that supports immersive and 3D audio experiences, making it suitable for technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR).

### **Characteristics**

- Open-source project
- Collection of libraries and tools
- For handling multimedia files and streams (audio/video)
- Can use it for free ‚ÄúFree Licence‚Äù (GPL/LGPL)

### **FFmpeg is commonly used in**

1. **Format Conversion**: FFmpeg can convert audio and video files between different formats. This is particularly useful when you need to make media content compatible with different devices, software, or platforms.
2. **Video Compression**: FFmpeg includes various codecs and compression algorithms that allow you to reduce the size of video files without compromising too much on quality. This is important for efficient storage and streaming.
3. **Audio Manipulation**: You can use FFmpeg to manipulate audio files by changing their formats, bit rates, sample rates, and channels. It can also apply effects, normalize audio levels, and perform other audio-related tasks.
4. **Video Editing**: While FFmpeg is not a full-fledged video editing software, it can perform basic video editing tasks like cutting, trimming, merging, and concatenating video clips.
5. **Streaming**: FFmpeg supports live streaming and adaptive streaming protocols, making it suitable for broadcasting live events or creating online streaming platforms.
6. **Transcoding**: Transcoding involves converting media content from one codec to another. FFmpeg is often used for this purpose, especially when dealing with video platforms, streaming services, or different hardware devices that require specific codecs.
7. **Batch Processing**: You can automate batch processing tasks with FFmpeg, allowing you to apply the same operation to multiple files.
8. **Command-Line Interface**: FFmpeg provides a command-line interface, which gives you fine-grained control over various settings and options. This is particularly useful for advanced users and developers who want to integrate multimedia processing into scripts and applications.
9. **Customization**: FFmpeg's open-source nature allows developers to modify and extend its functionality to suit specific needs. This makes it adaptable for a wide range of projects.
10. **Cross-Platform**: FFmpeg is available for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. This cross-platform compatibility makes it accessible to users on different systems.
